## Abstract:
Predicting stock market movements is a well-known problem of interest. 
Now-a-days social media is perfectly representing the public sentiment and opinion about current events.
Especially, twitter has attracted a lot of attention from researchers for studying the public sentiments.
Stock market prediction on the basis of public sentiments expressed on twitter
has been an intriguing field of research. Previous studies have concluded that the aggregate public mood collected from twitter
may well be correlated with Dow Jones Industrial Average Index
(DJIA). The thesis of this work is to observe how well the changes
in stock prices of a company, the rises and falls, are correlated
with the public opinions being expressed in tweets about that
company. Understanding authorâ€™s opinion from a piece of text
is the objective of sentiment analysis.we have applied sentiment analysis and supervised machine
learning principles to the tweets extracted from twitter and
analyze the correlation between stock market movements of a
company and sentiments in tweets. In an elaborate way, positive
news and tweets in social media about a company would definitely
encourage people to invest in the stocks of that company and as a
result the stock price of that company would increase. At the end
of the project,We have shown that a strong correlation exists between
the rise and falls in stock prices with the public sentiments in
tweets.
